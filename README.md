# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures written in C# and primarily aimed for use in competitive programming.

The contents of the repository are the following:

- High-performance input/output (taken from [Kattis website](https://open.kattis.com/help/csharp));
- Graphs:
  - Convenient way of initializing (directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted) graph as:
    - Vertex set;
    - Adjacency matrix;
    - Adjacency list;
  - Graph traversal algorithms:
    - DFS
      - Using vertex set (iterative + recursive with backtracking);
      - Using adjacency matrix (iterative + recursive with backtracking); 

# Contributing

It's as easy as "1-2-3":

1. Clone `master` branch of this repository;
2. Make the changes you want;
3. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/volpav/dotnet-algorithms/pulls);

I appreciate every effort, whether that is fixing bugs, improving existing algorithms' performance, adding more convenient interfaces, contributing new algorithms or simply altering documentation.
